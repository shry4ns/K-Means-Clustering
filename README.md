# K-Means-Clustering
Very rudimentary implementations of k-means clustering

I implemented k-means clustering of the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data. 
The matlab version is hand done. It is not completely optimized, and future versions will hope to optimize the code. 

The python version is implementation of the in-built algorithm in sckit-learn. 

## Dependencies (Python)
sklearn

numpy

## How to use it:
Simply clone it into your desktop. Make sure the relative paths to read csv file are working, if you choose to download somewhere else. Might need changing, but if you download onto desktop it should work fine.
